Python Is Dynamically Typed Language.This is one of the most important feature of the python.
#Let's focus on the Definition of the Statically Type Language and Dynamically Typed Language.
Statically Typed Language :
Those computer languages in which the type of variable is declared at the time of writing that
variable are referred to as statically typed language.
e.g. Java,C++,C
Dynamically Typed Language:
Those computer languages in which the type of variable is declared at the time of writing that
variable are referred to as statically typed language.
e.g. Python,JavaScript

3. Type checking of the variable occurs at compile time.   Type checking of the variable occurs at runtime.
